           - Here I have created a folder (repository) in my folder called ajzellmer
 
 2. Practice what you just learned by adding a new file to the OxyCompBio/hello-world-assignment-yourusername repository using the following steps:
 
    a. Follow the steps you learned in the Hello-World tutorial to create a new file called Answers.md:
       - First, make sure that you are in the correct repository: OxyCompBio/hello-world-assignment-yourusername
       - Create a branch to begin editing
       - Click "Create new file" and type in Answers.md
       - Answer the following Question: In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing?

       - Create a pull request and merge
       
 3. Go to https://github.com/OxyCompBio/Comp-Bio-SDMs and upload your SDM data
 
    a. Create a folder and README.md file for your species using the steps you learned in the Hello-World tutorial by completing the following:

           - The name of your species
           - Your name
           - The bioclim layers that you used after removing correlated variables
